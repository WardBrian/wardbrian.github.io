My undergraduate thesis, compeleted as part of my Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science
at Boston College. My topic of study was a formally verified parser for the language 
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), as part of a larger project by my advisors (Joseph Tassarotti and 
Jean-Baptiste Tristan) to verify a [complete Stan compiler](https://github.com/jtristan/ProbCompCert/tree/pcp).
